# Choeropsis

Choeropsis is an app to automate generation of screenshots via BrowserStack.

## TODO

- ~~Get rid of models except project, batch, snap~~
- ~~Define YAML schema for projects to host~~
- ~~Pull in YAML & use for BS request~~
- ~~Slack integration~~
- ~~Pretty up thumbnails view with Bootstrap~~
- ~~Make some methods async~~
- ~~Make a sample Circle command~~
- Change ENV var structure to use a regex rather than keeping all in a single variable
- Switch remote config to a section in manifest.yml
- Maybe generate an image (composite of thumbnails) to push to Slack
- Test again once BrowserStack has more bandwidth
- Hook up with QA Fire
- Write a proper readme
